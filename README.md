# 🎯 Mini Project: Number Guessing Game

A beginner-friendly command-line game written in Python by **Jabez Jesudason Jena**. The player tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 10, receiving feedback on whether their guess is too high or too low.

## 🕹️ How It Works

- The program randomly chooses a number from 1 to 10.
- You keep guessing until you get it right.
- You'll get hints like "Too High!" or "Too Low!" after each wrong guess.

## 📌 Features

- Random number generation
- Feedback on guesses
- Infinite guessing loop until correct
- Clean CLI-based interaction

## 💻 Sample Gameplay
